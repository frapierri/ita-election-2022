## Files description

`fb_ids_urls` and `ig_ids_urls` contain daily ".csv" files for Facebook and Instagram data, respectively. Rows provide the <i>platformId</i> and <i>postUrl</i> of each post, which can be used to retrieve the original post via Crowdtangle or access it in the browser directly (for more details see [Crowdtangle]([https://github.iu.edu/NaN-team/midterm2022/wiki](https://github.com/CrowdTangle/API/wiki)) documentation) <br>

`tw_ids` contains daily ".txt" files for Twitter data. Each file provides IDs of tweets that can be used to re-hydrate tweets using [Hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator) or [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc). <br>

`keywords.txt` contains the list of election-related keywords employed for collecting the data on different platforms. These were obtained through a snowball sampling approach starting with seeds such as "elezioni" or "elezioni2022". <br>

`meta_ads_ids.txt` contains the list of IDs of ads collected in the dataset. These can be used to retrieve ads through [Meta Ad Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library) API or search console. <br>

`*_metadata.csv` files contain metadata for YouTube and TikTok videos shared on Twitter and Facebook. YouTube metadata was collected through the official API whereas TikTok metadata was scraped using [pyktok](https://github.com/dfreelon/pyktok) library <br>

`*_representative_handles.csv` files contain social media handles associated to Italian representatives. <br>
